          <p>
            With the rise of online learning, there's no shortage of classes you
            can take that offer you a certification in a particular trade, skill
            or software program. But outside of positions that require
            certifications — pilots, emergency medical technicians and insurance
            agents, for example — do any of these make a real difference in a
            job application? We reached out to recruiters and HR professionals
            to get the answer. The consensus: Certifications certainly can make
            a difference, but not all certifications are created equal. Below
            are some of the ones that recruiters say actually move the needle in
            their decision to hire a candidate — if one of them is relevant to
            your field, consider looking into it!
